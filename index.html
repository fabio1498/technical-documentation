              C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and
              type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build
              many types of secure and robust applications that run in the .NET
              ecosystem. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will
              be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript
              programmers. This tour provides an overview of the major
              components of the language in C# 8 and earlier. If you want to
              explore the language through interactive examples, try the
              introduction to C# tutorials.
            </p>
            <p>
              C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language.
              C# provides language constructs to directly support these
              concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use
              software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to
              support new workloads and emerging software design practices.

              C# programs run on .NET, a virtual execution system called the
              common language runtime (CLR) and a set of class libraries. The
              CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the common language
              infrastructure (CLI), an international standard. The CLI is the
              basis for creating execution and development environments in which
              languages and libraries work together seamlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Source code written in C# is compiled into an intermediate
              language (IL) that conforms to the CLI specification. The IL code
              and resources, such as bitmaps and strings, are stored in an
              assembly, typically with an extension of .dll. An assembly
              contains a manifest that provides information about the assembly's
              types, version, and culture.

              The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to introduce a
              programming language. Here it is in C#:
            </p>
            <pre>
              <code> 
  <span class="bluetext">using</span> System;

  <span class="bluetext">class</span> <span class="lightbluetext">Hello</span>
  {
      <span class="bluetext">static void</span> <span class="lightbluetext">Main()</span>
      {
          Console.WriteLine(<span class="orangetext">"Hello, World"</span>);
      }
  }		
              </code>
                </pre>
            <p>
              The "Hello, World" program starts with a
              <code class="code">using</code> directive that references the
              <code class="code">System</code> namespace. Namespaces provide a
              hierarchical means of organizing C# programs and libraries.
              Namespaces contain types and other namespaces—for example, the
              <code class="code">System</code> namespace contains a number of
              types, such as the <code class="code">Console</code> class
              referenced in the program, and a number of other namespaces, such
              as <code class="code">IO</code> and
              <code class="code">Collections</code>. A
              <code class="code">using</code> directive that references a given
              namespace enables unqualified use of the types that are members of
              that namespace. Because of the
              <code class="code">using</code> directive, the program can use
              <code class="code">Console.WriteLine</code> as shorthand for
              <code class="code">System.Console.WriteLine</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code class="code">Hello</code> class declared by the "Hello,
              World" program has a single member, the method named
              <code class="code">Main</code>. The
              <code class="code">Main</code> method is declared with the
              <code class="code">static</code> modifier. While instance methods
              can reference a particular enclosing object instance using the
              keyword <code class="code">this</code>, static methods operate
              without reference to a particular object. By convention, a static
              method named <code class="code">Main</code> serves as the entry
              point of a C# program.

            <p>
              There are two kinds of types in C#: value types and reference
              types. Variables of value types directly contain their data.
              Variables of reference types store references to their data, the
              latter being known as objects. With reference types, it's possible
              for two variables to reference the same object and possible for
              operations on one variable to affect the object referenced by the
              other variable. With value types, the variables each have their
              own copy of the data, and it isn't possible for operations on one
              to affect the other (except for <code class="code">ref</code> and
              <code class="code">out</code> parameter variables).
            </p>
            <p>
              An identifier is a variable name. An identifier is a sequence of
              unicode characters without any whitespace. An identifier may be a
              C# reserved word, if it's prefixed by <code class="code">@</code>.
              Using a reserved word as an identifier can be useful when
              interacting with other languages.
            </p>
            <p>
              C#'s <b>value types</b> are further divided into
              <em
                >simple types, enum types, struct types, nullable value types,
                and tuple value types</em

              C#'s <b>reference types</b> are further divided into

              C# programs use <em>type declarations</em> to create new types. A
              type declaration specifies the name and the members of the new
              type. Six of C#'s categories of types are user-definable: class
              types, struct types, interface types, enum types, delegate types,
              and tuple value types.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A <code class="code">class</code> type defines a data structure
                that contains data members (fields) and function members
                (methods, properties, and others). Class types support single
                inheritance and polymorphism, mechanisms whereby derived classes
                can extend and specialize base classes.
              </li>
              <li>
                A <code class="code">struct</code> type is similar to a class
                type in that it represents a structure with data members and
                function members. However, unlike classes, structs are value
                types and don't typically require heap allocation. Struct types
                don't support user-specified inheritance, and all struct types
                implicitly inherit from type <code class="code">object</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                An <code class="code">interface</code> type defines a contract
                as a named set of public members. A
                <code class="code">class</code> or
                <code class="code">struct</code> that implements an
                <code class="code">interface</code> must provide implementations
                of the interface's members. An interface may inherit from
                multiple base interfaces, and a
                <code class="code">class</code> or
                <code class="code">struct</code> may implement multiple
                interfaces.

                A <code class="code">delegate</code> type represents references
                to methods with a particular parameter list and return type.
                Delegates make it possible to treat methods as entities that can
                be assigned to variables and passed as parameters. Delegates are
                analogous to function types provided by functional languages.
                They're also similar to the concept of function pointers found
                in some other languages. Unlike function pointers, delegates are
                object-oriented and type-safe.

              <code class="code">interface</code>, and

              whereby they can be parameterized with other types.

              C# supports single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays of any
              type. Unlike the types listed above, array types don't have to be
              declared before they can be used. Instead, array types are
              constructed by following a type name with square brackets. For
              example, <code class="code">int[]</code> is a single-dimensional
              array of <code class="code">int</code>,
              <code class="code">int[,]</code> is a two-dimensional array of
              <code class="code">int</code>, and
              <code class="code">int[][]</code> is a single-dimensional array of
              single-dimensional arrays, or a "jagged" array, of
              <code class="code">int</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              C#'s type system is unified such that a value of any type can be
              treated as an <code class="code">object</code>. Every type in C#
              directly or indirectly derives from the
              <code class="code">object</code> class type, and
              <code class="code">object</code> is the ultimate base class of all
              types. Values of reference types are treated as objects simply by
              viewing the values as type <code class="code">object</code>.
              Values of value types are treated as objects by performing
              <em>boxing</em> and <em>unboxing operations</em>. In the following
              example, an <code class="code">int</code> value is converted to
              <code class="code">object</code> and back again to
              <code class="code">int</code>.
            </p>
            <pre>C# code
	  <code>
<span class="bluetext"> int</span> i = <span class="lightgreentext">123</span>;
<span class="bluetext"> object</span> o = i;    <span class="greentext">// Boxing</span>
<span class="bluetext"> int</span> j = (<span class="bluetext">int</span>)o;  <span class="greentext">// Unboxing</span></code>
	  </pre>
            <p>
              When a value of a value type is assigned to an
              <code class="code">object</code> reference, a "box" is allocated
              to hold the value. That box is an instance of a reference type,
              and the value is copied into that box. Conversely, when an
              <code class="code">object</code> reference is cast to a value
              type, a check is made that the referenced
              <code class="code">object</code> is a box of the correct value
              type. If the check succeeds, the value in the box is copied to the
              value type.
            </p>

              There are several kinds of <em>variables</em> in C#, including
              fields, array elements, local variables, and parameters. Variables
              represent storage locations. Every variable has a type that
              determines what values can be stored in the variable, as shown
              below.

              The key organizational concepts in C# are *programs _,
              <em>namespaces</em>, <em>types</em>, <em>members</em>, and
              <em>assemblies</em>. Programs declare types, which contain members
              and can be organized into namespaces. Classes, structs, and
              interfaces are examples of types. Fields, methods, properties, and
              events are examples of members. When C# programs are compiled,
              they're physically packaged into assemblies. Assemblies typically
              have the file extension <code class="code">.exe</code> or
              <code class="code">.dll</code>, depending on whether they
              implement applications or _*libraries**, respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a small example, consider an assembly that contains the
              following code:
            </p>
            <pre>C# code
		<code>
<span class="bluetext"> using</span> System;

    <span class="bluetext">public class</span> <span class="lightbluetext">Stack</span>(<span class="lightbluetext">t</span>)
    {
        Entry _top;
        
        <span class="bluetext">public void</span> <span class="lightbluetext">Push</span>(T data)
        {
            _top = <span class="bluetext">new</span> Entry(_top, data);
        }

        <span class="bluetext">public</span> T <span class="lightbluetext">Pop</span>()

            }
            T result = _top.Data;
            _top = _top.Next;

            {
                Next = next;

              The fully qualified name of this class is
              <code class="code">Acme.Collections.Stack</code>. The class
              contains several members: a field named
              <code class="code">top</code>, two methods named
              <code class="code">Push</code> and <code class="code">Pop</code>,
              and a nested class named <code class="code">Entry</code>. The
              <code class="code">Entry</code> class further contains three
              members: a field named <code class="code">next</code>, a field
              named <code class="code">data</code>, and a constructor. The
              <code class="code">Stack</code> is a <em>generic class</em>. It
              has one type parameter, <code class="code">T</code> that is
              replaced with a concrete type when it's used.
            </p>
            <p>
              Assemblies contain executable code in the form of Intermediate
              Language (IL) instructions, and symbolic information in the form
              of metadata. Before it's executed, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler
              of .NET Common Language Runtime converts the IL code in an
              assembly to processor-specific code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because an assembly is a self-describing unit of functionality
              containing both code and metadata, there's no need for
              <code class="code">#include</code> directives and header files in
              C#. The public types and members contained in a particular
              assembly are made available in a C# program simply by referencing
              that assembly when compiling the program. For example, this
              program uses the
              <code class="code">Acme.Collections.Stack</code> class from the
              <code class="code">acme.dll</code> assembly:
            </p>
            <pre>C# code

            <p>
              To compile this program, you would need to <em>reference</em> the
              assembly containing the stack class defined in the earlier
              example.
            </p>
            <p>
              C# programs can be stored in several source files. When a C#
              program is compiled, all of the source files are processed
              together, and the source files can freely reference each other.
              Conceptually, it's as if all the source files were concatenated
              into one large file before being processed. Forward declarations
              are never needed in C# because, with few exceptions, declaration
              order is insignificant. C# doesn't limit a source file to
              declaring only one public type nor does it require the name of the
              source file to match a type declared in the source file.

          <article>
            <p>
              C# and .NET provide many different collection types. Arrays have
              syntax defined by the language. Generic collection types are
              listed in the System.Collections.Generic namespace. Specialized
              collections include System.Span(T) for accessing continuous memory
              on the stack frame, and System.Memory(T) for accessing continuous
              memory on the managed heap. All collections, including arrays,
              Span(T), and Memory(T) share a unifying principle for iteration.
              You use the System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable(T) interface.
              This unifying principle means that any of the collection types can
              be used with LINQ queries or other algorithms. You write methods
              using IEnumerable(T) and those algorithms work with any
              collection.

          <article>
            <p>
              An *array _ is a data structure that contains a number of
              variables that are accessed through computed indices. The
              variables contained in an array, also called the
              <em>elements</em> of the array, are all of the same type. This
              type is called the <em>_ element type*</em> of the array.
            </p>
            <p>
              Array types are reference types, and the declaration of an array
              variable simply sets aside space for a reference to an array
              instance. Actual array instances are created dynamically at
              runtime using the <code class="code">new</code> operator. The
              <code class="code">new</code> operation specifies the length of
              the new array instance, which is then fixed for the lifetime of
              the instance. The indices of the elements of an array range from
              <code class="code">0</code> to
              <code class="code">Length - 1</code>. The
              <code class="code">new</code> operator automatically initializes
              the elements of an array to their default value, which, for
              example, is zero for all numeric types and
              <code class="code">null</code> for all reference types.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following example creates an array of
              <code class="code">int</code> elements, initializes the array, and
              prints the contents of the array.
            </p>
            <pre>C# Code
		<code>
 <span class="bluetext">int</span>[] a = <span class="bluetext">new int</span>[<span class="lightgreentext">10</span>];
 <span class="bluetext">for</span> (<span class="bluetext">int</span> i = <span class="lightgreentext">0</span>; i  a.Length; i++)
 {
    a[i] = i * i;
 }
 <span class="bluetext">for</span> (<span class="bluetext">int</span> i = <span class="lightgreentext">0</span>; i  a.Length; i++)
 {
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="orangetext">$"a[</span>{i}<span class="orangetext">] =</span> {a[i]}<span class="orangetext">"</span>);
 } 
 </code>
</pre>
            <p>
              This example creates and operates on a *<b
                >single-dimensional array</b
              >
              _. C# also supports <em>multi-dimensional arrays</em>. The number
              of dimensions of an array type, also known as the
              <em>_ rank*</em> of the array type, is one plus the number of
              commas between the square brackets of the array type. The
              following example allocates a single-dimensional, a
              two-dimensional, and a three-dimensional array, respectively.

              C# <em>string interpolation</em> enables you to format strings by
              defining expressions whose results are placed in a format string.
              For example, the following example prints the temperature on a
              given day from a set of weather data:
            </p>
            <pre>
		<code>
 Console.WriteLine(<span class="orangetext">$"The low and high temperature on</span> {weatherData.Date:MM-DD-YYYY}<span class="orangetext">"</span>);
 Console.WriteLine(<span class="orangetext">$"</span>    was {weatherData.LowTemp} <span class="orangetext">and</span> {weatherData.HighTemp}<span class="orangetext">."</span>);
 <span class="greentext">// Output (similar to):
 // The low and high temperature on 08-11-2020
 //     was 5 and 30.</span>
		</code>
		</pre>
            <p>
              An interpolated string is declared using the
              <code class="code">$</code> token. String interpolation evaluates
              the expressions between <code class="code">{</code> and
              <code class="code">}</code>, then converts the result to a
              <code class="code">string</code>, and replaces the text between
              the brackets with the string result of the expression. The
              <code class="code">:</code> in the first expression,
              <code class="code">{weatherData.Date:MM-DD-YYYY}</code> specifies
              the format string. In the preceding example, it specifies that the
              date should be printed in "MM-DD-YYYY" format.
